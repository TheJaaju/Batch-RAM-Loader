# Batch-ram-test
A batch file that creates a text document that when opened will stress your ram

How to use:
1. Put the file somewhere (I'd use an usb stick or external hard drive)
2. Start the program (Be careful! This will start the creation of a large text document.)
3. Stop the program
4. open Task Manager (win+r taskmgr)
5. Open payload.txt using notepad.exe (This WILL eat your ram)
